## What's Tea Cozy?

Tea Cozy is a fictional tea shop that needed a digital storefront. I built this project from the ground up, with only the expected results, just pure coding based on a concept. The goal was to create a website that not only looked inviting but was also highly functional and easy to navigate.

## Why Tea Cozy?

After getting my hands dirty with the basics of HTML and CSS, I wanted to challenge myself further. Flexbox was the mountain I chose to climb. Why? Because Flexbox is a powerful tool for designing flexible and efficient layouts. This project was my playground for experimenting with it, allowing me to explore its capabilities in creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

## How I Brewed It

### Flexing Flexbox Muscles

I dived into Flexbox, using it to lay out the website's sections, align content, and make it responsive. The magic of Flexbox made it easier to arrange elements in complex layouts without losing my mind.

### Responsive Design

Using Flexbox, I ensured that the Tea Cozy website is as cozy on a mobile screen as it is on a desktop. It was all about making sure that no matter where you're viewing it from, the experience remains seamless and engaging.

### No walk-through, Just Creativity

I relied on my creativity and understanding of HTML and CSS to bring the Tea Cozy to life. It was a journey of trial and error, learning, and ultimately, creating something I'm proud of.
